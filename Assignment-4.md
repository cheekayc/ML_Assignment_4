Note: You must turn in an R-Markdown word document with your code and
generated output clearly labeled. Make sure all answers to specific
questions are clearly labeled. Do not just turn in unannotated output.
This assignment builds upon group work from class. You can consult with
fellow students on strategies, but the document you turn in must be your
own, individual work. Group members cannot turn in the same R-markdown
word document.

REMEMBER TO SET YOUR SEED USING 123 TO ENSURE REPRODUCIBLE RESULTS.

# Part I: Implementing a Simple Prediction Pipeline

The New York City Department of Health administered a questionnaire on
general health and physical activity among residents. Using the dataset
`class4_p1.csv`, fit and evaluate two prediction models using linear
regression. The aim of the models are to predict the number of days in a
month an individual reported having good physical health (feature name:
`healthydays`).

### Step 1: Load and clean dataset

``` r
class4 = read_csv("./Data/class4_p1.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(-x1) %>% 
  mutate(
    chronic1 = as_factor(chronic1),
    chronic3 = as_factor(chronic3),
    chronic4 = as_factor(chronic4),
    tobacco1 = as_factor(tobacco1),
    alcohol1 = as_factor(alcohol1),
    habits5 = as_factor(habits5),
    habits7 = as_factor(habits7),
    agegroup = as_factor(agegroup),
    dem3 = as_factor(dem3),
    dem4 = as_factor(dem4),
    dem8 = as_factor(dem8),
    povertygroup = as_factor(povertygroup)) %>% 
  drop_na()
```

### Step 2: Partition data into training and testing (use a 70/30 split)

``` r
set.seed(123)

train.index = createDataPartition(class4$healthydays, p = 0.7, list = FALSE)

class4_train = class4[train.index, ]
class4_test = class4[-train.index, ]
```

## Problem 1

Fit two prediction models using different subsets of the features in the
training data.

- **Model 1**
  - Outcome: healthydays
  - Predictors: chronic4, gpaq8totmin, gpaq11days, habits5, habits7 &
    agegroup
- **Model 2**
  - Outcome: healthydays
  - Predictors: bmi, tobacco1, alcohol1, habits5 & habits7

``` r
model_1 = lm(healthydays ~ chronic4 + gpaq8totmin + gpaq11days + habits5 + habits7 + agegroup, data = class4_train)

model_2 = lm(healthydays ~ bmi + tobacco1 + alcohol1 + habits5 + habits7, data = class4_train)
```

## Problem 2

Apply both models within the test data and determine which model is the
preferred prediction model using the appropriate evaluation metric(s).

We will be using **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)** as the appropriate
evaluation metric to compare how well the model is predicting against
the actual values.

``` r
rmse(model_1, class4_test)
```

    ## [1] 7.218366

``` r
rmse(model_2, class4_test)
```

    ## [1] 7.401421

Based on the result, it appears that *Model 1* is a better model in
predicting the number of days in a month an individual reported having
good physical health because it has a lower RMSE value compared to Model
2.

## Problem 3

One setting where the implementation of *Model 1* would be useful is
when we hope to predict a personâ€™s overall perceived health in a senior
community.

# Part II: Conducting an Unsupervised Analysis

Using the dataset from the Group assignment Part 3 (USArrests), identify
clusters using hierarchical analysis. Use an agglomerative algorithm for
hierarchical clustering. Use a Euclidian distance measure to construct
your dissimilarity matrix.

### Step 1: Load dataset & prepare for analysis

``` r
data("USArrests")
# Checked no missing data.

# Check means and SDs to determine if scaling is necessary:
colMeans(USArrests, na.rm = TRUE)
```

    ##   Murder  Assault UrbanPop     Rape 
    ##    7.788  170.760   65.540   21.232

``` r
apply(USArrests, 2, sd, na.rm = TRUE)
```

    ##    Murder   Assault  UrbanPop      Rape 
    ##  4.355510 83.337661 14.474763  9.366385

``` r
# Means and standard deviations are very different from each other. Scaling is needed.
US_Arrests = scale(USArrests)
```

## Problem 4

We will be conducting a hierarchical clustering analysis using the
***complete*** linkage.

``` r
# Create Dissimilarity matrix
diss.matrix = dist(US_Arrests, method = "euclidean")

# Hierarchical clustering using Complete Linkage
clusters.h = hclust(diss.matrix, method = "complete" )

# Plot the obtained dendrogram
plot(clusters.h, cex = 0.6, hang = -1)
```

#### a) Determine the optimal number of clusters using ***gap-statistic*** analysis.

``` r
gap_stat = clusGap(US_Arrests, FUN = hcut, K.max = 10, B = 50)
fviz_gap_stat(gap_stat)
```

![](Assignment-4_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

Based on the result, the optimal number of clusters is *3*.

#### b) Describe the composition of each cluster in terms of the original input features

``` r
clusters = kmeans(US_Arrests, 3, nstart = 25)

clusters

*Cluster 1* has a medium urban population size, but they have the
greatest rate in murder, assault, and rape because all the values for
each features are positive (\>0) and are the highest among all three
clusters. *Cluster 2* has the smallest proportion of urban population,
as well as the lowest crime rate because all the values for each
features are negative (\<0) and are the smallest among all three
clusters. *Cluster 3* has the biggest urban population. Its crime rate
(murder, assault, rape) is not the lowest but still lower than average.

## Problem 5

One research question that can be addressed using the newly identified
clusters is: What are some contributing elements to the high crime rate
in the Cluster 1 states?

Before using these clusters for the above research question, we should
be careful for not including the state name in the cluster to avoid
defaming certain states.
